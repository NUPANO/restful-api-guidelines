[#162]
== {MUST} use REST maturity level 2

We strive for a good implementation of
http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2[REST
Maturity Level 2] as it enables us to build resource-oriented APIs that
make full use of HTTP verbs and status codes. You can see this expressed
by many rules throughout these guidelines, e.g.:

* <<138>>
* <<141>>
* <<148>>
* <<150>>

Although this is not HATEOAS, it should not prevent you from designing
proper link relationships in your APIs as stated in rules below.
