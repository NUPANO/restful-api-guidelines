== {MUST} use standard data formats

https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#data-types[Open API]
(based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#section-7.3[JSON Schema Validation vocabulary])
defines formats from ISO and IETF standards for date/time, integers/numbers and binary data.
You *must* use these formats, whenever applicable:

*Note:* Formats `bigint` and `decimal` have been added to the OpenAPI defined formats --
see also <<171>> and <<169>> below.


[#171]
== {MAY} define a format for number and integer types

In <<238>> we added `bigint` and `decimal` to the OpenAPI defined formats.
As an implication, you must always provide one of the formats `int32`, `int64`, `bigint`
or `float`, `double`, `decimal` when you define an API property of
JSON type `number` or `integer`.

By this we prevent clients from guessing the precision incorrectly, and thereby
changing the value unintentionally. The precision must be translated by clients
and servers into the most specific language types; in Java, for instance, the `number`
type with `decimal` format will translate into `BigDecimal` and `integer` type with
`int32` format will translate to `int` or `Integer` Java types.


[#239]
=== {MUST} encode binary data in `base64url`

You may expose binary data. You must use a standard media type and data format,
if applicable -- see <<168, Rule 168>>. If no standard is available, you must define
the binary data as `string` typed property with `binary` format using `base64url`
encoding -- as also described in <<238>>.


[#126]
[#169]
== {MUST} use standard formats for date and time properties

As a specific case of <<238>>, you must use the `string` typed formats
`date`, `date-time`, `time`, `duration`, or `period` for the definition of date and time properties.
The formats are based on the standard {RFC-3339}[RFC 3339] internet profileâ€‰-- a
subset of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#ref-ISO8601[ISO 8601].

APIs {MUST} use the upper-case `T` as a separator between date and time and
upper-case `Z` at the end when generating dates as opposed to lower-case `t`,
`z`, space, or any other character. This is stricter than the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[date/time format
as defined in RFC 3339], which leaves it up to the specification.

*Exception:* For passing date/time information via standard protocol headers,
HTTP https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1[RFC 7231] requires to
follow the date and time specification used by the Internet Message Format
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322[RFC 5322].

As defined by the standard, time zone offset may be used, however, we recommend
to only use times based on UTC without local offsets. For example `2015-05-28T14:07:17Z`
rather than `2015-05-28T14:07:17+00:00`. From experience we have learned that zone
offsets are not easy to understand and often not correctly handled. Note also that
zone offsets are different from local times which may include daylight saving time.
When it comes to storage, all dates should be consistently stored in UTC without
a zone offset. Localization should be done locally by the services that provide
user interfaces, if required.

*Hint:* We discourage using numerical timestamps. It typically creates
issues with precision, e.g. whether to represent a timestamp as 1460062925,
1460062925000 or 1460062925.000. Date strings, though more verbose and requiring
more effort to parse, avoid this ambiguity.


[#255]
== {SHOULD} select appropriate one of date or date-time format

When choosing between `date` and `datetime` formats you should take into account the following:

* `date` should be used for properties where no exact point in time is required and day time-range is sufficient,
for instance, document dates, birthdays, ETAs (estimated time of arrival).
Without further context, `date` implies the time period from midnight to midnight in the local time zone.
However, the timezone information can be also provided
as an additional context information via other fields indicating location.
* `datetime` should be used in all other cases where an exact point in time is required, 
for instance, datetimes for supplier advice, specific processing events, fast delivery planning dates.
As required in <<169>>,  `datetime` requires the explicit time zone offset to be provided,
which avoids misinterpretations and eliminates the need of an additional context to provide.


[#127]
== {TODO} {SHOULD} use standard formats for time duration and interval properties

Properties and that are by design durations and time intervals should be
represented as strings formatted as defined by {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601]
({RFC-3339}#appendix-A[RFC 3339 Appendix A contains a grammar] for `durations`
and `periods` - the latter called time intervals in {ISO-8601}[ISO 8601]). ISO
8601:1-2019 defines an  extension (`..`) to express open ended time intervals
that are very convenient in searches and are included in the below
{RFC-2234}[ABNF] grammar:

[source,abnf]
----
   dur-second        = 1*DIGIT "S"
   dur-minute        = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
   dur-hour          = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
   dur-time          = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
   dur-day           = 1*DIGIT "D"
   dur-week          = 1*DIGIT "W"
   dur-month         = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-day]
   dur-year          = 1*DIGIT "Y" [dur-month]
   dur-date          = (dur-day / dur-month / dur-year) [dur-time]
   duration          = "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)
   
   period-explicit   = iso-date-time "/" iso-date-time
   period-start      = iso-date-time "/" (duration / "..")
   period-end        = (duration / "..") "/" iso-date-time
   period            = period-explicit / period-start / period-end
----

A time interval query parameter should use `<time-property>_between` instead
of the parameter pair `<time-property>_before`/`<time-property>_after`, while
properties providing a time interval should be named `<time-property>_interval`.


[#128]
[#170]
== {MUST} use standard formats for country, language and currency properties

As a specific case of <<238>> you must use the following standard formats:

* Country codes: {ISO-3166-1-alpha-2}[ISO 3166-1-alpha-2] two letter country
  codes indicated via format `iso-3166-alpha-2` in the OpenAPI specification.
* Language codes: {ISO-639-1}[ISO 639-1] two letter language codes indicated
  via format `iso-639-1` in the OpenAPI specification.
* Language variant tags: {BCP47}[BCP 47] multi letter language tag indicated
  via format `bcp47` in the OpenAPI specification. (It is a compatible extension
  of {ISO-639-1}[ISO 639-1] with additional optional information for language
  usage, like region, variant, script)
* Currency codes:  {ISO-4217}[ISO 4217] three letter currency codes indicated
  via format `iso-4217` in the OpenAPI specification.

[#144]
== {MUST} only use UUIDs as identifiers

Generate only UUIDs Version 4 as unique identifiers for resources.
