[#148]
== {MUST} use HTTP methods correctly

Be compliant with the standardized HTTP semantics (see {RFC-9110}[RFC-9110
"HTTP semantics"]) as summarized here.


[[get]]
=== GET

{GET} requests are used to *read* either a single or a collection resource.

* {GET} requests for individual resources will usually generate a {404} (if the
  resource does not exist).
* {GET} requests for collection resources may return either {200} (if the
  collection is empty) or {404} (if the collection is missing).
* {GET} requests must NOT have a request body payload.

[[put]]
=== PUT

{PUT} requests are used to *update* (and sometimes to create) *entire*
resources â€“ single or collection resources. The semantic is best described
as _"please put the enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by
the URL, replacing any existing resource."_.

* {PUT} requests are usually applied to single resources, and not to collection
  resources, as this would imply replacing the entire collection.
* {PUT} requests are usually robust against non-existence of resources by
  implicitly creating the resource before updating.
* On successful {PUT} requests, the server will *replace the entire resource*
  addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the payload.
  Subsequent reads will deliver the same payload, plus possibly
  server-generated fields like `modifiedAt`.
* Successful {PUT} requests return {200} or {204} (if the resource was updated
  -- with or without returning the resource), {201} (if the resource was newly
  created), and {202} (if the request was accepted for asynchronous
  processing).

The updated/created resource may be returned as response payload. We recommend,
to not use it per default, but if the resource is enriched with
server-generated fields like `versionNumber`. You may also support client side
steering (see <<181>>).

*Important:* It is good practice to keep the resource identifier management
under control of the service provider and not the client, and, hence, to prefer
{POST} for creation of (at least top-level) resources, and focus {PUT} on its
usage for updates. However, in situations where the identifier and all resource
attributes are under control of the client as input for the resource creation
you should use {PUT} and pass the resource identifier as URL path parameter.
Putting the same resource twice is required to be <<idempotent>> and to result
in the same single resource instance (see <<149>>) without data duplication in
case of repetition.

*Hint:* To prevent unnoticed concurrent updates and duplicate creations when
using {PUT}, you <<182>> to allow the server to react on stricter demands that
expose conflicts and prevent lost updates. See also <<optimistic-locking>> for
details and options.


[[post]]
=== POST

{POST} requests are idiomatically used to *create* single resources on a
collection resource endpoint, but other semantics on single resources endpoint
are equally possible. The semantic for collection endpoints is best described as
_"please add the enclosed representation to the collection resource identified
by the URL"_. The semantic for single resource endpoints is best described as
_"please execute the given well specified request on the resource identified by
the URL"_.

* Successful {POST} requests on a collection endpoint will create one or more
  resource instances.
* For single resources, you {SHOULD} return {201} and the new resource object
  (including the resource identifier) in the response payload.
** The client {SHOULD} be able to use this resource identifier to {GET} the
   resource if supported by the API (see <<143>>).
** The URL to {GET} the resource {SHOULD} be provided in the {Location} header.
** If the response does not contain the created resource or a resource monitor,
  the status code {SHOULD} be {201} and the URL to {GET} the resource {MUST} be
  provided in the {Location} response header.

WARNING: The resource identifier {MUST-NOT} be passed as request body data by the client, but created and maintained by the service.

* For multiple resources you {SHOULD} return {201} in the response, as long as
  they are created atomically, meaning that either all the resources are created
  or none of them are.
** You <<152>> if the request can partially fail, that is some of the resources
  can fail to be created.

* You <<253>>, where the resource creation would not finish by the time the
  request is delivered, so the response status code {SHOULD} be {202}.

Apart from resource creation, {POST} should be also used for scenarios that
cannot be covered by the other methods sufficiently. However, in such cases
make sure to document the fact that {POST} is used as a workaround.

[#delete]
=== DELETE

{DELETE} requests are used to *delete* resources. The semantic is best
described as _"please delete the resource identified by the URL"_.

* {DELETE} requests are usually applied to single resources, not on
  collection resources, as this would imply deleting the entire collection.
* {DELETE} request can be applied to multiple resources at once using query
  parameters on the collection resource (see <<delete-with-query-params>>).
* Successful {DELETE} requests return {200} or {204} (if the resource was
  deleted -- with or without returning the resource), or {202} (if the request
  was accepted for asynchronous processing).
* Failed {DELETE} requests will usually generate {404} (if the resource cannot
  be found) or {410} (if the resource was already traceably deleted before).

*Important:* After deleting a resource with {DELETE}, a {GET} request on the
resource is expected to either return {404} (not found) or {410} (gone)
depending on how the resource is represented after deletion. Under no
circumstances the resource must be accessible after this operation on its
endpoint.

[[delete-with-body]]
=== DELETE with body payload

In rare cases {DELETE} may require additional information, that cannot be
classified as filter parameters and thus should be transported via request body
payload, to perform the operation. Since {RFC-9110}#section-9.3.5[RFC-9110
Section 9.3.5] states, that {DELETE} has an undefined semantic for payloads, we
recommend to utilize {POST}. The response status code of {DELETE-with-Body} requests should be similar to usual {DELETE} requests.


[[head]]
=== HEAD

{HEAD} requests are used to *retrieve* the header information of single
resources and resource collections.

* {HEAD} has exactly the same semantics as {GET}, but returns headers only, no
  body.

*Hint:* {HEAD} is particular useful to efficiently lookup whether large
resources or collection resources have been updated in conjunction with the
{ETag}-header.


[[options]]
=== OPTIONS

{OPTIONS} requests are used to *inspect* the available operations (HTTP
methods) of a given endpoint.

* {OPTIONS} responses usually either return a comma separated list of methods
  in the `Allow` header or as a structured list of link templates.

*Note:* {OPTIONS} is rarely implemented, though it could be used to
self-describe the full functionality of a resource.

*Note:* {OPTIONS} must be accessible without authentication

[#149]
== {MUST} fulfill common method properties

Request methods in RESTful services can be...

* [[safe, safe]]{RFC-safe} -- the operation semantic is defined to be read-only,
  meaning it must not have _intended side effects_, i.e. changes, to the server
  state.
* [[idempotent, idempotent]]{RFC-idempotent} -- the operation has the same
  _intended effect_ on the server state, independently whether it is executed
  once or multiple times. *Note:* this does not require that the operation is
  returning the same response or status code.
* [[cacheable, cacheable]]{RFC-cacheable} -- to indicate that responses are
  allowed to be stored for future reuse. In general, requests to safe methods
  are cacheable, if it does not require a current or authoritative response
  from the server.

*Note:* The above definitions, of _intended (side) effect_ allows the server
to provide additional state changing behavior as logging, accounting, pre-
fetching, etc. However, these actual effects and state changes, must not be
intended by the operation so that it can be held accountable.

Method implementations must fulfill the following basic properties according
to {RFC-9110}#section-9.2[RFC 9110 Section 9.2]:

[cols="15%,15%,35%,35%",options="header",]
|====================================================
| Method    | Safe  | Idempotent | Cacheable
| {GET}     | {YES} | {YES}      | {YES}
| {HEAD}    | {YES} | {YES}      | {YES}
| {POST}    | {NO}  | {NO}       | {NO}
| {PUT}     | {NO}  | {YES}      | {NO}
| {DELETE}  | {NO}  | {YES}      | {NO}
| {OPTIONS} | {YES} | {YES}      | {NO}
|====================================================

*Note:* <<227>>.

[#253]
== {MAY} support asynchronous request processing

Typically REST APIs are designed as synchronous interfaces where all
server-side processing and state changes initiated by the call are finished
before delivering the result as response. However, in long running request
processing situations you may make use of asynchronous interface design with
multiple calls: one for initiating the asynchronous processing and subsequent
ones for accessing the processing status and/or result.

We recommend an API design that represents the asynchronous request processing
explicitly via a job resource that has a status and is different from the
actual business resource. For instance, `POST /report-jobs` returns HTTP status
code {201} to indicate successful initiation of asynchronous processing
together with the _job-id_ passed in the response payload and via the URL of
the {Location} header. The _job-id_ or {Location} URL then can be used to poll
the processing status via `GET /report-jobs/{id}` which returns HTTP status
code {200} with job status and optional report-id as response payload. Once
returned with job status `finished`, the report-id is provided and can be used
to fetch the result via `GET /reports/{id}` which returns {200} and the report
object as response payload.

Alternatively, if you do not to follow the recommended practice of providing a
separate job resource, you may use `POST /reports` returning a status code
{202} together with the {Location} header to indicate successful initiation of
the asynchronous processing. The {Location} URL is used to fetch the report via
`GET /reports/{id}` which returns either {200} and the report resource or {202}
without payload, if the asynchronous processing is still ongoing.

*Hint:* Do *not* use response code {204} or {404} instead of {202} here -- it
is misleading since neither is the processing successfully finished, nor do we
want to suggest a client failure.


[#154]
== {MUST} define collection format of header and query parameters

Header and query parameters allow to provide a collection of values, either
by providing a comma-separated list of values or by repeating the parameter
multiple times with different values as follows:

[,cols="14%,30%,39%,17%",options="header",]
|=========================================================================
| Parameter Type | Comma-separated Values | Multiple Parameters | Standard
| Header | `Header: value1,value2` | `Header: value1, Header: value2`
| {RFC-9110}#section-5.3[RFC 9110 Section 5.3]

| Query | `?param=value1,value2` | `?param=value1&param=value2`
| {RFC-6570}#section-3.2.8[RFC 6570 Section 3.2.8]
|=========================================================================

As OpenAPI does not support both schemas at once, an API specification must
explicitly define the collection format to guide consumers as follows:

[,cols="14%,40%,46%",options="header",]
|===============================================================
| Parameter Type | Comma-separated Values | Multiple Parameters
| Header | `style: simple, explode: false` | not allowed (see
  {RFC-9110}#section-5.3[RFC 9110 Section 5.3])
| Query  | `style: form, explode: false`   | `style: form, explode: true`
|===============================================================

When choosing the collection format, take into account the tool support,
the escaping of special characters and the maximal URL length.


[#236]
== {TODO} {SHOULD} design simple query languages using query parameters

We prefer the use of query parameters to describe resource-specific query
languages for the majority of APIs because it's native to HTTP, easy to extend
and has an excellent implementation support in HTTP clients and web frameworks.

By simple query language we mean one or more name-value pairs that are combined
in one way only with `and` semantics.

Query parameters should have the following aspects specified:

* Reference to corresponding property, if any
* Value range, e.g. inclusive vs. exclusive
* Comparison semantics (equals, less than, greater than, etc)
* Implications when combined with other queries, e.g. _and_ vs. _or_

How query parameters are named and used is up to individual API designers, here
are a few tips that could help to decide whether to use simple or more complex
query language:

Consider using simple query language when API is built to be used by others
   (external teams):

   * no additional effort/logic to form the query
   * no ambiguity in meaning of the query parameters. For example
     in `GET /items?user_id=gt:100`, is `user_id` greater than `100` or
    is `user_id` equal to `gt:100`?
   * easy to read, no learning curve

The following examples should serve as ideas for simple query language:

=== Equals

* `name=Zalando`, `creation_year=2023`, `updated_by=user1` (query elements
  based on property equality)
* `created_at=2023-09-18T12:12:00.000Z`, `age=18` (query elements
  based on logical properties)
* `color=red,green,blue,multicolored` (query elements based on multiple
  choice possibility)

=== Less than

* `max_length=5` -- query elements based on upper/lower bounds (`min` and `max`)
* `shorter_than=5` -- query elements using terminology specific e.g. to _length_
* `price_lower_than=50` or `price_lower_than_or_equal=50`
* `created_before=2019-07-17` or `active_until=2023-09-18T12:12:00.000Z`
** Using terminology specific to time: _before_, _after_, _since_ and _until_

=== More than

* `min_length=2` -- query elements based on upper/lower bounds (`min` and `max`)
* `created_after=2019-07-17` or `modified_since=2019-07-17`
** Using terminology specific to time: _before_, _after_, _since_ and _until_
* `price_higher_than=50` or `price_equal_or_higher_than=50`

=== Pagination

* `offset=10` and `limit=5` (query elements for pagination regardless
  customer sorting)
* `limit=5` and `created_after=2019-07-17` (query elements for
  keyset pagination)
** when sorting is in place and new elements are inserted, it prevents showing
   repeated/missing results due to offset shift.

Please check <<137, conventional query parameters for pagination and sorting>>
and you can also find additional info in <<pagination>> section below.

We don't advocate for or against certain names because in the end APIs should
be free to choose the terminology that fits their domain the best.


[#226]
== {MUST} document implicit response filtering

Sometimes certain collection resources or queries will not list all the
possible elements they have, but only those for which the current client is
authorized to access.

Implicit filtering could be done on:

* the collection of resources being returned on a {GET} request
* the fields returned for the detail information of the resource

In such cases, the fact that implicit filtering is applied must be documented
in the API specification's endpoint description. Consider <<227,caching
aspects>> when implicit filtering is provided. Example:

If an employee of the company _Foo_ accesses one of our business-to-business
service and performs a `{GET} /business-partners`, it must, for legal reasons,
not display any other business partner that is not owned or contractually
managed by her/his company. It should never see that we are doing business
also with company _Bar_.

Response as seen from a consumer working at `FOO`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Foo Performance" },
        { "name": "Foo Sport" },
        { "name": "Foo Signature" }
    ]
}
----

Response as seen from a consumer working at `BAR`:

[source,json]
----
{
    "items": [
        { "name": "Bar Classics" },
        { "name": "Bar pour Elle" }
    ]
}
----

The API Specification should then specify something like this:

[source,yaml]
----
paths:
  /business-partner:
    get:
      description: >-
        Get the list of registered business partner.
        Only the business partners to which you have access to are returned.
----
